Running the Program:
-Each of the functions created here can be run in Matlab, and each function should have what it is used for, and the desired inputs and outputs if you run "help <functionname>"
- Three scripts have been provided to run my code for each of the three computational programs that have been provided with this assignment, they are "run_Problem1.m", "run_Problem2.m", and "run_Problem3.m".
-Please use these functions to run my work for these problems.
	-Each of these functions load provided .mat files that hold the data for each problem.
	-To run the files please CD into the HW1 top level directory, and then type the script names into the matlab command line.
	-Please make sure all the data files described below are stored in directory titled "Data" one level below the parent directory.
Data Files:
-All of the data that is needed to run the programs, which are the three mat files "dataset1a.mat", "dataset1b.mat", and "dataset2.mat" are in the zipped file in the data directory.

Contact:
- If you have any difficulty running any of the programs please let me know, I can be reached at the email stated above.
